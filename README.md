# 🚀 Rocketry Flight Software

## 📌 Project Overview
This **Rocketry Flight Software** is designed to monitor, collect, and process real-time telemetry data from a rocket during its flight. The software provides an interactive **CustomTkinter-based interface**, featuring real-time telemetry display, graphical data visualization, and location tracking using **Folium** maps. The system ensures **efficient data storage and processing using MongoDB**, enabling seamless retrieval and analysis.

## 🔥 Features
- **Real-time Telemetry Display:** Continuously updates altitude, speed, orientation, and system health.
- **Graphical Data Visualization:** Dynamic charts and graphs using **Matplotlib**.
- **Flight Path Mapping:** Real-time rocket tracking using **Folium**.
- **Data Storage & Handling:** Efficiently stores telemetry data in **MongoDB**.
- **Command Interface:** Allows sending telecommands for in-flight operations.
- **Threaded Processing:** Ensures smooth operation without UI lag.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Technology:
  - Python: Core language for development
  - CustomTkinter: Graphical User Interface (GUI) for ground control
  - Matplotlib: Graphical representation of telemetry data
  - Folium: Mapping and real-time rocket location tracking
  - MongoDB: Real-time telemetry data storage
  - Threading: Manages multiple processes efficiently
  - OS Module: Interacts with the operating system for file handling
  - Subprocess Module: Executes external commands for system operations
  - Webbrowser Module: Opens HTML-based map visualization
  - XBee Wireless Module: Handles real-time data transmission


## 🚀 Why These Technologies?
- **CustomTkinter**: Lightweight, modern, and easily integrates with Python-based data visualization.
- **Matplotlib**: Provides simple yet powerful real-time graphing capabilities.
- **Folium**: Interactive mapping and easy integration with Python.
- **MongoDB**: Handles high-frequency telemetry queries efficiently compared to MySQL or Firebase.
- **Threading**: Maintains real-time telemetry processing without UI freezing.
- **XBee Wireless Module**: Ensures reliable, low-latency data transmission from the rocket to the ground station.
